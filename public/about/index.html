			We recognize that the underprivileged women and girls are

			mentally and violations in the realization of their rights, entitlements

			equipped with the proper resources, women and young girls have the power
			to transform their own lives and help their entire family, hence
			readdressing the cause of poverty and social injustice in the community.

				<h4>Adedunni Sakirat Adedoyin</h4>
				<p>
					She is a Nigerian and a social entrepreneur. She co- founded
					Firstpoint Allianz Foundation as a non- governmental organization
					(NGO) that focuses on improving the lives of indigent women, widows,
					children’s education support, orphans, and vulnerable children.
				</p>

				<p>
					Her passion for Humanitarian and community service has made her stand
					her out among others. “Finding myself among the needy made me realize
					they are just disadvantaged as some are very intelligent and smart and
					what they need is help and support”. A single person can’t carry the
					burden, so the idea came to try and pull together, comfortable and
					compassionate individuals to support, impact and touch lives, to make
					living better.
				</p>

				<p>
					She has years of working experience with some private establishment
					before proceeding to co founding a Non-Governmental Organisation
					(Firstpoint Allianz Foundation)
